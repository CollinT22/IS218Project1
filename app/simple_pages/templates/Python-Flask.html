   <h1> Python and Flask </h1>
    <h1> Testing with Python and Flask </h1>
    <p1>Pytest lets you write code to test if your existing code is working. It is done by writing testing code
    that checks whether or not your code is producing the correct output through assertations. </p1>
    <h1> Test Example </h1>
    <p1>def test_request_index(client): <br>
    """This makes the index page"""<br>
    response = client.get("/")<br>
    assert response.status_code == 200<br>
    assert b"Index Page" in response.data<br></p1>
    <h1> Pytest examples </h1>
    <p1>Pytest examples in simple pages offer assertations to see if the pages are there in the file structure. The project on Github
    can be found <a href="https://github.com/CollinT22/IS218Project1">here</a></p1>
